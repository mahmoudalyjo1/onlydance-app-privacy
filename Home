💡 Our Vision: A world where everyone knows at least one cool dance move (yes, even you!).


➡️ Meet the Founders 🎉

Behind every great dance move, there’s a team making it happen! Meet the masterminds who built Only Dance. Three passionate innovators who love tech, dance, and bringing people together.

💡 Mahmoud Salah – CEO & PMO: Project Manager
The guy who keeps everything running smoothly! Mahmoud is the mastermind behind planning and making sure your experience on Only Dance is as flawless as your best dance move.

💡 Khaled Ed (Dj Dva) – CEO & Code Choreographer (Developer & DJ)
By day, he’s a developer making sure the app runs like a dream. By night, he’s a DJ, dropping beats that keep dance floors packed! Whether he’s coding features or mixing tracks, Khaled brings rhythm and energy to everything he does.

💡 Mohamed Hassona – CEO & Tech Beatmaker (Developer & Dancer Extraordinaire)
Not only does he build the app, but he also dominates the dance floor! Mohamed is a top-tier developer and a fantastic dancer, proving that great footwork applies to both coding and dancing. If there’s music playing, you’ll probably find him showing off some killer moves!

Together, these three are turning their passion for dance and technology into a platform that gets people moving! 💃🕺
